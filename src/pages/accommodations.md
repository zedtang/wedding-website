## De Tierra Accommodations

The venue will also be the place of accommodation for all guests during the wedding. Since our venue has a limited capacity to the max amount of guests that can stay on the property, we have booked out the entire property for the wedding weekend for guests to stay in.

The venue has sleeping arrangements for up to 32 guests. There are multiple rooms and beds in the property where guests will be staying. These rooms are spread out across a few separate buildings on the property as well.

Everyone coming to the wedding will have a place to stay on the property. You don't need to worry about finding a place to stay. We have you covered!

> Note: 10 of the guests will be staying off the main property in a house that is "technically" a part of the property but is a short walk away from the main house.
