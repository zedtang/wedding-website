If you have any questions, fit pics or concerns - please reach out to Flora or Jiaheng.

## What’s the weather?

The expected temperature of October there ranges from 13°C to 24°C (55°F to 75°F).
Given that ceremony will be outdoor and celebration will continue into the evening, pls keep in mind the change of temperature and pack layers.

## Can I bring a plus one?
We’ve decided to keep our wedding intimate, which means those who can bring a plus one will have been notified.

## How would I get there?

For our out-of-town guests, we recommend flying into San Francisco International Airport(SFO). If you have time, we recommend checking out the Half Moon Bay, we love the ocean view there. We do recommend arrive 1 day in advance to allow yourselves to settle in, but if you’re planning to fly in on the same day, pls expect a 90 - 120 min drive from SFO to the Grand Island Mansion.

For our local bay area guests, you can drive to the venue, there’re ample parking spaces there;
We also recommend carpooling to share some fun conversations on your way;
We’re looking into hiring wedding shuttle service too. (More details will be shared in the coming months).

## I'm traveling from out of town, where do I stay?

If you’re arriving before the wedding day, we recommend staying at the
Hyatt Regency Santa Clara - close to our home in Sunnyvale.
On the wedding day, we invite all of our out-of-town guests to stay with us overnight.

The wedding venue is at the Grand Island Mansion. <Placeholder for venue policy from the office>
