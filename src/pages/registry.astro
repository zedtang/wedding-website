  <h2>Our Wedding Registry</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Note: This registry page is a work in progress and will be updated as we get closer to the wedding date.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We are so excited to celebrate our wedding with you and are so grateful for your love and support. We currently don't have a home or a true place we are living at the moment. That being said, we have a few registries setup but would prefer to receive donations to our travel fund or to our environmental fund. We are so excited to continue traveling together and right now in our lives, that is more important to us than home furnishings. We are also very passionate about the environment and would love to donate to a fund that helps protect our planet. We are so excited to celebrate with you and can't wait to see you at the wedding!
